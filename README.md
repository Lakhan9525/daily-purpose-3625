# TimeCamp Clone

This project is a clone of the [Time Camp](https://www.timecamp.com/) website. During our construct week in Masai School, we as a group of 5 members collaborated and cloned the website within 4 days time.

TimeCamp is a web-based application launched in 2009 by Kamil Rudnicki, a programmer and founder of Time Solutions, to track the activity of computer users and it is dedicated either to freelancers or teams. The tool is a time tracking software to invoice the employees' work based on an hourly rate, measuring the work effectiveness and project management.
